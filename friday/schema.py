"""The renderer contract, mirrored from src/lib/store.ts.

This is the seam the whole architecture turns on (§25): the model never emits
drawing code, only a spec naming a component the frontend already knows how to
render. Keep these types in lockstep with `VisualizationSpec` in store.ts — a
field that exists here but not there renders as nothing.
